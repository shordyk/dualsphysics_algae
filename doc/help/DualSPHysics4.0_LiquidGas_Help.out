=======================================================
Information about execution parameters:

  DualSPHysics4 [name_case [dir_out]] [options]

  Options:
    -h          Shows information about parameters

    -opt <file> Loads a file configuration

    -cpu        Execution on CPU (option by default)
    -gpu[:id]   Execution on GPU and id of the device
    -stable     The result is always the same but the execution is slower

    -posdouble:<mode>  Precision used in position for particle interactions
        0: Use and store in single precision (option by default)
        1: Use double precision but saves result in single precision
        2: Use and store in double precision

    -ompthreads:<int>  Only for CPU execution, indicates the number of threads
                   by host for parallel execution, this takes the number of 
                   cores of the device by default (or using zero value)

    -blocksize:<mode>  Defines BlockSize to use in particle interactions on GPU
        0: Fixed value (128) is used (option by default)
        1: Optimum BlockSize indicated by Occupancy Calculator of CUDA
        2: Optimum BlockSize is calculated empirically

    -cellmode:<mode>  Specifies the cell division mode
        2h        Lowest and the least expensive in memory (by default)
        h         Fastest and the most expensive in memory

    -symplectic      Symplectic algorithm as time step algorithm
    -verlet[:steps]  Verlet algorithm as time step algorithm and number of
                     time steps to switch equations

    -cubic           Cubic spline kernel
    -wendland        Wendland kernel

    -viscoart:<float>          Artificial viscosity [0-1]
    -viscolamsps:<float>       Laminar+SPS viscosity [order of 1E-6]
    -viscoboundfactor:<float>  Multiplies the viscosity value of boundary

    -deltasph:<float> Constant for DeltaSPH. Typical value is 0.1 (0 by default)

    -shifting:<mode> Specifies the use of Shifting correction
        none       Shifting is disabled (by default)
        nobound    Shifting is not applied near boundary
        nofixed    Shifting is not applied near fixed boundary
        full       Shifting is always applied

    -sv:[formats,...] Specifies the output formats.
        none    No particles files are generated
        binx    Binary files (option by default)
        info    Information about execution in .ibi4 format
        vtk     VTK files
        csv     CSV files
    -svres:<0/1>     Generates file that summarises the execution process
    -svtimers:<0/1>  Obtains timing for each individual process
    -svdomainvtk:<0/1>  Generates VTK file with domain limits
    -name <string>      Specifies path and name of the case 
    -runname <string>   Specifies name for case execution
    -dirout <dir>       Specifies the out directory 

    -partbegin:begin[:first] dir 
     Specifies the beginning of the simulation starting from a given PART
     (begin) and located in the directory (dir), (first) indicates the
     number of the first PART to be generated

    -incz:<float>    Allows increase in Z+ direction 
    -rhopout:min:max Excludes fluid particles out of these density limits

    -ftpause:<float> Time to start floating bodies movement. By default 0
    -tmax:<float>   Maximum time of simulation
    -tout:<float>   Time between output files

    -domain_particles[:xmin,ymin,zmin,xmax,ymax,zmax]  The domain is fixed as
     a function of the initial article positions and modified for xmin,...
    -domain_particles_prc:xmin,ymin,zmin,xmax,ymax,zmax  The values in 
     proportion with the case dimensions according to the initial particles
    -domain_fixed:xmin,ymin,zmin,xmax,ymax,zmax    The domain is fixed
     with the specified values

  Examples:
    DualSPHysics4 case out_case -sv:binx,csv
