Information about execution parameters:

  ReadSwash [options]

  Options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information

  Creates CSV files with velocity.
    -savecsv <file.sws> <file.csv>  Generates CSV files with velocity X, Y and

  Creates corrected CSV files.
    -correctcsv:tmax[:steps] <filein.csv> <fileout.csv>  Generates CSV files
     with corrected velocity until indicated time using one or several segments
     according steps value. Steps is 1 by default and using 0 any correction is
     applied.
