The CaseML_Pistons1D_CIEM is empploying the geometry and the wave conditions from an experimental campaing carried out 
at the Canal d’Investigació i Experimentació Marítima (CIEM) of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), in Barcelona.
The CIEM flume is a large-scale wave flume of 100m length, 3m width and 4.5m depth. 

Several experiments were carried out within the framework of the Scandura data set [Scandura & Foti, 2011], part of the Hydralab III EU-funded project.
Regular waves are used for the present case study.

SWASH model has been previously validated against the experimental data. Then, location for the coupling between SWASH and DualSPHysics model
has been set at x=43.10m from the initial position of the experimental wavemaker at rest.

The bacth file w01_CaseML_CIEM_SWASH_win64.bat executes SWASH (v.5.01), extract the velocity data at the coupling location and create .vtk files to visualize 
the velocity and the displacement of the Moving-Layer Piston in Paraview.

The batch file w02_CaseML_CIEM_win64_GPU executes DualSPHysics and the post-processing tools.
