For CaseSloshingAcc, the box does not move, the orientation of the gravity vector changes. 
The linear acceleration vector (LinearAccx, LinearAccy, LinearAccz) in CaseSloshingAccData is that gravity vector. 


For CaseSloshingMotion, the box itself does a rotating motion while the gravity vector is constant; 
the angle (say f) is moving compared to the initial position and it is given by CaseSloshingMotionData. 
_Sloshing_Rotation also shows the new position of the corner.


This angle f is the same angle used to find the x, y and z components of the gravity vector in CaseSloshingAcc. 
Essentially LinearAccx=9.81*sinf and LinearAccz=9.81*cosf similar to how you find the positions in _Sloshing_Rotation.
The angular acceleration can be found from the angle f through difference schemes, as AngAcc=d (df/dt)/dt. 
There is no need to do that however, as the acceleration has already been provided by the people doing the experiment for the SPHERIC Benchmark 
and it is available in the SPHERIC website. We simply used rad/s instead of deg/s.

The Center of Acceleration is the pivoting point of the box, where the torque for moving the box is applied. 
It is the only point whose coordinates do not change in CaseSloshingMotion and it is at the center of the bottom of the box.
