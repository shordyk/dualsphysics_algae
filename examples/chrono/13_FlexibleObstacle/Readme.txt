The flexural behavior of the obstacle is achieved following the approach developed in [Capasso et al., 2022]*.

The case proposed is a simplified version of one presented in the paper, as the damping properties are here neglected and the parameters are set to minimize the computational effort.

Model comparison is realized computing the marker motion by means of rigid body dynamics (Marker 1 is placed 0.0025 meters far from the flexible obstacle free-end). Data (surge and pitch) are drawn from _FtInfo_mk29.csv.
